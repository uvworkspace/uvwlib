# uvwlib

Common utilities for uvworkspace. Instead of breaking into multiple packages,
folders in this package are categorized as:

* pure javascripts
* utilities for browser
* utilites using Node.js

Each folder has some purpose and has no or minimal dependencies respecting the category
it belongs to, so that later a folder may be factored out into a separate package easily.
